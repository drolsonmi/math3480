# Math 3480 Course Schedule - Spring 2025
These are the topics that we plan to cover this semester:
* Data Preprocessing (some items reviewed from previous semesters)
* Model Evaluation
* Classification Models
* Regression Models
* Clustering Models
* Natural Language Processing

Topics I need to introduce
* Ensemble Learning

Following is my planned schedule for the course. It is incomplete at this point, but will be changed as the semester progresses. The textbooks and videos are found on the [Textbooks](https://github.com/drolsonmi/math3080/blob/main/3480_Textbooks.md) page.
