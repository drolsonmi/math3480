# Math 3480 - Machine Learning - Snow College

These are the lecture notes I will use for class in our Machine Learning Course at Snow College. As I make changes, I will update these notes here on github.

You are welcome to keep a copy of these notes for your own reference after class.

If you have any questions, or if you note any problems with these notes, feel free to let me know and I can take a look. Have fun this semester!
