# Math 3480 Course Schedule - Spring 2025
This semester, we will look at the full Machine Learning process:
* Data Preprocessing (some items reviewed from previous semesters)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (items reviewed from previoius semesters)
* Cross Validation
* Model Training
* Model Teesting and Evaluation

We will look at 4 different modeling types:
* Classification Models
* Regression Models
* Clustering Models
* Natural Language Processing

Following is my planned schedule for the course. It is incomplete at this point, but will be changed as the semester progresses. The textbooks and videos are found on the [Textbooks](https://github.com/drolsonmi/math3480/blob/main/3480_Textbooks.md) page.
