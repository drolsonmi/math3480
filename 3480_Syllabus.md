## Grading Policy
| Assignment   | Percentage of Grade |
| :----------- | :-----------------: |
| Homework     | 20%                 |

### Assignment Overview
__Homework__ will be assigned occasionally throughout the course to give practice in Machine Learning techniques.

__Projects__ will be assigned to challenge the student and to check the student’s understanding of the material.

A __Midterm Exam__ will be given before Spring Break. It will cover material from the beginning of the semester to that point to test application of techniques discussed.

A __Final Exam__ will cover some questions regarding what has been learned during the semester, as well as opportunities to demonstrate techniques learned through the semester.

### Late Policy
All __homework assignments__ and __class projects__ will be accepted for 70% credit for one week after the due date. Homework submitted one week after the due date or later will not be accepted. Class activities will not be accepted after the due date unless it is discussed with me before the due date.

I understand that emergencies happen. As such __I will waive the late penalty for up to 3 late homework assignments__. Otherwise, late homework submissions need to be discussed with me prior to the due date to avoid the late penalty.

All exams must be taken in the allotted time. If you cannot take the exam in the requested time, then you must coordinate with me *no later than one week before the exam is due*.

### Taking the Final Exam early
A request to take a final exam at any time other time than when it is officially scheduled must be initiated with the professor and approved by the Dean or Department Chair at least two weeks before the scheduled final exam. A charge of $50.00 per exam will be assessed if the request is approved.

Information on taking the final exam early can be found on the [Snow College Final Exam](https://snow.edu/offices/registrar/final_exams.html) page.

## Using AI in this class
Generative AI is a technology that automates part or all of the writing and content creation process. Popular examples include ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic), and others. 

Statistics is actually the core of Generative AI. Computers use statistics and probabilities to determine output text. We will learn a little more about Generative AI in the class.

Throughout the semester, you may only use generative AI when I provide specific direction to do so. We will use generative AI in a guided way to ensure that course learning outcomes and pedagogy are fully supported.

As the instructor, I reserve the right to disqualify homework, project, and exam scores from the grade if there is evidence of improper AI use. If improper AI use is suspected, I may call you in to discuss the situation. __Remember that you are in charge of your own education__. Do not cheat yourself just to make life easy. You won't have that chance in the professional world.
